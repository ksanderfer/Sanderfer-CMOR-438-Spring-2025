# CMOR 438 / INDE 577 Data Science & Machine Learning

This repository houses various concepts and algorithms taught during the Spring 2025 semester at Rice University, divided into supervised and unsupervised approaches. Within each approach is a Python file which can be imported as a package for use in any project and a Jupyter Notebook walking through the motivation for the approach and demonstrating a use-case on a dataset. 

This repository is a work-in-progress that will be finished by early May.

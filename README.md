# CMOR 438 / INDE 577 Data Science & Machine Learning

This repository houses various concepts and algorithms taught during the Spring 2025 semester at Rice University, divided into supervised and unsupervised approaches. Within each approach is a Python file which can be imported as a package for use in any project and a Jupyter Notebook walking through the motivation for the method and demonstrating a use-case on financial datasets from [Quandl](quandl.com).

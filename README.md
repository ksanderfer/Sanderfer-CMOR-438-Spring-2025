# Machine Learning: Implementations and Examples for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

This repository houses various concepts and algorithms taught during the Spring 2025 semester of CMOR 438 at Rice University, divided into supervised and unsupervised approaches. Within each approach is a Python file which can be imported as a package for use in any project and a Jupyter Notebook walking through the motivation for the method and demonstrating a use-case on various finance-related datasets. My custom implementations are featured in the Perceptron and K Nearest Neighbors notebooks. In other notebooks, existing packages are used for the sake of focusing on the algorithm at hand more than the specific implementation.
